FizzBuzz is mathematics game where one counts using the words Fizz and Buzz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz

The initial commit in this project was a previous 30 min coding session at a work event to show junior developers how tests could be written.

In this project one can also play with extra rules, where divisible numbers of 4 should be Fuzz and divisible numbers of 9 should be Jazz.
The game can also be played backwards.
